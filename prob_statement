The current organizational structure, where two data engineers serving as database administrators are assigned to a specific development team rather than the support division, is causing inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes in data infrastructure planning and management. This arrangement results in:

Lack of holistic perspective in data infrastructure planning
Misaligned priorities, as a single team lead determines database and data architecture activities for the entire organization
Confusion and poor designs when other teams and divisions request assistance
Ineffective planning and management of data resources at an organizational level

This problem affects multiple stakeholders, including:

The data engineers themselves
The development team they're assigned to
Other teams and divisions requiring database and data architecture support
The overall organization's data infrastructure and its effectiveness
