To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.\n\nSuccessful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.\n\nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If Azure SQL Database does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system.

In SQL, these are -- or /* */ \n-- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.\n-- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.\n-- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. \n-- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.\n-- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.\n-- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.\n-- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.\n-- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways.

Ownership is usually acquired implicitly when creating the object or by explicit ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control and the permissions related to that access. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.\n\nWhen DAC policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects.\n\nA subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.\n\nThe policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of DCA require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":[],"ccis":["CCI-002165"],"reference_identifier":"5500","uuid":"29888557-21b8-4e24-a91e-acb911dab82a","stig_uuid":"827d6d20-89e5-4538-8b10-a85f92d96d68","status":"not_reviewed","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Tool: \r\nTime: \nResult: NR"},{"group_id_src":"V-255317","group_tree":[{"id":"V-255317","title":"SRG-APP-000342-DB-000302","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-255317","severity":"medium","group_title":"Azure SQL Database must restrict execution of stored procedures and functions that utilize [execute as] to necessary cases only.","rule_id_src":"SV-255317r961359_rule","rule_id":"SV-255317r961359","rule_version":"ASQL-00-002900","rule_title":"Azure SQL Database must restrict execution of stored procedures and functions that utilize [execute as] to necessary cases only.","fix_text":"Alter stored procedures and functions to remove the \"EXECUTE AS\" statement.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Review the system documentation to obtain a listing of stored procedures and functions that utilize impersonation.
