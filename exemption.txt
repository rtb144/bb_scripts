# Exemptions in the Azure Sky

In realms of cloud where data streams and flows,
Where digital fortresses rise and security grows,
There lies a moment, delicate and rare,
When rules must bend with calculated care.

The firewall stands, a sentinel so bright,
Guarding networks through day and night,
But sometimes paths must carefully part,
An exemption granted with a strategic art.

Networked rules in their rigid design,
Sometimes need a nuanced, careful line,
A port opened, a protocol allowed,
With scrutiny precise and logic endowed.

Each exemption is a calculated risk,
A dance of trust, a security disk,
Weighing protection against connection's need,
Measured in bytes, in each careful deed.

Azure's landscape of virtual might,
Where governance rules with technical light,
Grants passage when the reasoning's sound,
Balancing safety on uncertain ground.

So grant your exemption with wisdom's hand,
Trace each pathway across the digital land,
For in the cloud where complexity reigns,
Security's art is knowing where flexibility remains.
