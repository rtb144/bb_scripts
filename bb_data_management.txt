INT. WALT'S LAB - DAY

Walt and Jesse are hard at work in the lab, surrounded by beakers, flasks, and other equipment. But today, their focus is on data management.

JESSE:
(sighing)
I can't believe we're spending all this time on data management. This is boring, Mr. White.

WALT:
(grimly)
Jesse, data management is crucial for our operation. Without it, we could make mistakes that could get us caught. We have to keep track of everything.

JESSE:
(pouting)
Fine, but can't we just let the computers handle it? They're good at that kind of stuff.

WALT:
(shaking his head)
No, we have to be hands-on with this. We can't trust the machines completely. We have to make sure everything is entered correctly, every time.

Jesse grudgingly pulls out a pen and paper and begins to write down data from one of the flasks.

JESSE:
(muttering)
This is so tedious. I don't know how you do it, Mr. White.

WALT:
(sternly)
We have to do it, Jesse. And we have to do it right. Otherwise, we risk everything we've worked for.

As they work, Walt and Jesse begin to fall into a rhythm. Walt double-checks Jesse's work, making sure everything is entered correctly, while Jesse focuses on writing down the data as accurately as possible.

JESSE:
(grinning)
Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this.

WALT:
(nodding)
Good. We need to make sure our records are flawless.

As they continue working, Jesse realizes that there's a certain satisfaction to the process of data management. By keeping track of every detail, they're able to maintain control and minimize risk.

JESSE:
(smiling)
You know, this data management thing isn't so bad after all.

WALT:
(smiling)
I told you, Jesse. Attention to detail is what sets us apart.

FADE OUT.
